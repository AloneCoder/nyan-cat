nyan-cat
========

Nyan Cat made with HTML5+CSS3+JavaScript

Goals:
------

1. My main goal with this project is to recreate the Nyan Cat we love using nothing but HTML and CSS3 (HTML5 audio for the background music).
2. JavaScript is used with jQuery lib mainly to cycle element classes and duplicate some stuff in order to cover the entire screen.
3. MUST be responsive.
4. I want it to look exactly like the original Nyan Cat.

To Do List:
-----------

- [] Fix rainow glitch on various resolutions
- [] Add song (with loop)
- [] Improve Performance


Why not use CSS3 Transitions/Animations?
----------------------------------------

Cause they suck for what I wanna do, at least as far as I know, I can't create frames without a smooth transition between them, and that does not look like Nyan Cat at all.

This sucks, you suck, I can do it better and faster and cooler!
---------------------------------------------------------------

Please do so, just don't forget to teach me after doing it, cause I wanna know it too!
