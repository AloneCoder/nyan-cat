Nyan Cat made with HTML5+CSS3+JavaScript

<h2>Goals</h2>

<ol>
<li>The main goal with this project is to recreate the Nyan Cat we love using nothing but HTML and CSS3 (HTML5 audio for the background music).</li>
<li>JavaScript is used mainly to cycle the element classes and duplicate some stuff in order to cover the entire screen.</li>
<li>MUST be responsive.</li>
<li>I want it to look exactly like the original Nyan Cat.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Why not use CSS3 Transitions/Animations?</h2>

Cause they suck for what I wanna do, at least as far as I know, I can't create the frames without smoothly transition between them, and that does not look like Nyan Cat at all.

<h2>This sucks, you suck, I can do it better and faster!</h2>

Please do so, just don't forget to teach me after doing it, cause I wanna know it too!
