nyan-cat
========

[DEMO HERE](http://cristurm.github.io/nyan-cat/)

Nyan Cat made with HTML5+CSS3+JavaScript.

Goals:
------

1. My main goal with this project is to recreate the Nyan Cat we love using nothing but HTML and CSS3 (HTML5 audio for the background music).
2. JavaScript is used with jQuery lib mainly to cycle element classes and duplicate some stuff in order to cover the entire screen.
3. Must be responsive.
4. Must look exactly like the original Nyan Cat.

To Do List:
-----------

- ~~Fix rainow glitch on various resolutions.~~
- ~~Add song (with loop).~~
- Improve Performance.
- Remove JS for frames cycling


Why not use CSS3 Transitions/Animations?
----------------------------------------

Cause they didn't work well with background-gradoents at the momtent I was making it.
